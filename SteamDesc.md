[h1]Short Description:[/h1]

- This is a fork of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1813104049]Vassals Expanded and Reworked mod by lpslucasps[/url]. Most of the effects and the way everything works is the same as in the original, so please see the original's description for more info. I outline new features below.

[h1]New Features:[/h1]

- You can change your subject types after you've chosen them via a new edict. This is convenient because you can change from subject types that don't allow integration to ones that do, for example.

- You can change your subject's name. To do this, I made it so your subject name will change to the name of your Capital system. You can easily rename your capital system, and so, you can easily rename your subjects.

- You can change the authority type of your subject states.

- You can install your own leaders as the rulers of subject states.

- You can give subjects all of the technology that you have researched.

- Subjects will now get an impact to the stability of their planets and their faction happiness every time something is changed. This is to represent the populace's feeling of resentment at foreign intervention. Loyal subjects will have a lower stability hit, for less time. These effects will not apply for the first two times you change their name/subject type, or the first time you change their authority.

- Subject will now occassionally ask or demand to be released from vassalage. They will rarely ask (and never demand) if they are loyal, but will become increasingly likely to ask/demand the more disloyal they are. If you deny them from being released, there is a chance an independence war will break out. If you deny them when they demand it, an independence war will break out.

- If you have my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2434790082]Civil Wars mod[/url] installed, Subjects may also ask/demand to be made into Autonomus States, with all the same effects.

[h1]Notes:[/h1]

- As a normal empire, the Feudal Society civic gives you access to all normal subject types.

- As a megacorp, the Franchising civic gives you access to all corporate subject types.

- If you don't get a prompt to pick your subject type, wait a month. It should appear at the beginning of the next month.

- If  you have more than 10 subjects and want to change a subject's type, you may have to refresh the edict a few times to get it to appear on the list.
