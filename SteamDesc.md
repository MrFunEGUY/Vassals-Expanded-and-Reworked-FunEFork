[h1]Short Description:[/h1]

- This is a fork of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1813104049]Vassals Expanded and Reworked mod by lpslucasps[/url].


[hr][/hr]

[h1]New Contract Terms:[/h1]

- Ruler Designation: Determines whether or not the Overlord can change the subject's ruler. Limited Designation allows the Overlord to choose from amongst the subject's leaders, while Unrestricted Designation allows the Overlord to choose from their own ruler's as well.

- Government Restructuring: Determines whether or not the Overlord can change the subject's government authority (Democratic, Imperial, etc.).

- Domestic Affairs: Determines whether or not the Subject must align their policies with that of their Overlord. Once this is enabled, at that moment, and then every 5 years, the subject's policies will attempt to change to match those of the Overlord.

- Ethnic Affairs: Determines whether or not the Subject must align their species rights (Citizenship Type and Living Standards) with that of their Overlord. Once this is enabled, at that moment, and then every 5 years, the subject's species policies will attempt to change to match those of the Overlord.

- Capital Relocation: Determines whether the Overlord can relocate the capital of their subject.

- Naming Rights: Determines whether the overlord is allowed to rename their subject.

- Proxy War: Determines whether the Overlord is allowed to force the Subject to partake in Proxy Wars, which is a mechanic where the Overlord can direct a subject to attack someone without participating themselves.

[h1]Other Features:[/h1]

- All of the subject interaction features of the mod are handled through a new edict: Manage Subject States.

- You can create Planet-State vassals from individual planets via a planetary decision.

- Changing your subject's name: To do this, I made it so your subject name will change to the name of your Capital system. You can easily rename your capital system, and so, you can easily rename your subjects.

- You can give subjects all of the technology that you have researched.

- Taxes can be more fine-tuned, with separate tax options for each resource, and 5% increments.

- New Casus Belli and War Goal to take another empire's subject if they border you. Think Rome and Parthia fighting over Armenia.

--

- Subjects will now get an impact to the stability of their planets and their faction happiness every time something is changed. This is to represent the populace's feeling of resentment at foreign intervention. Loyal subjects will have a lower stability hit, for less time. These effects will not apply for the first two times you change their name/subject type, or the first time you change their authority.

--

- There is a new Casus Belli/War Goal to go to war to steal another nation's subject if the subject is neighboring you. If you win the war, you will be prompted to install a new leader in the subject nation (as this is how it has been done historically, think Rome and Parthia).

[h1]Notes:[/h1]

- Condiminum can only be made from Subjects who border a nation that is not your Subject.

- You can only have 1 of each type of Specialized Subject (Prospectorium/Scholarium/Bulwark)

- You may only have one Blood Tributary.

- If using my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2434790082]Civil Wars[/url] mod, place this mod after/below it in the load order.

- For the best experience, I recommend [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1623423360]UI Overhaul Dynamic.[/url] If you use it, you must place it after this mod in the load order.

- If you have more than 10 subjects and want to manage one, you may have to refresh the edict a few times to get the correct subject to appear on the list.
